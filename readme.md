# Farrm website

This is a repository dedicated for the development for the FARRM Website. The mockups are made by Robin Todde (FARRM) and Joren Knieper (FARRM). 
You can find the mock-ups for the website in the repository in the folder mock-ups where you can find the initial images too. 

## Deadlines 
The initial deadline is january. But there is no hurry. 

## To Do
For this project, I'm going to use a kanban board in github projects. So you can find the to do's in that kanban bord.
