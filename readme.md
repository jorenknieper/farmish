# Farrm website

This is a repository dedicated for the development for the FARRM Website. The mockups are made by Robin Todde (FARRM) and Joren Knieper (FARRM). 
You can find the mock-ups for the website in the repository in the folder mock-ups where you can find the initial images too. 

## Deadlines 
The initial deadline is january. But there is no hurry. 

## To Do
For this project, I'm going to use a kanban board in github projects you can find it here: [link to kanban](https://github.com/jorenknieper/farmish/projects/1).

##branches 
Because I'm developing on my own right now and I want to use this repository for when te website goes live,... I'm going to start with setting up de repository, adding some files. When I'm going to start coding, I'm going to use a dev branch. Push everything to the dev branch, test everything and then push it to master. At the end of the day, every dev branch will be merged to master, just to see how it looks on the github pages: [live demo](https://jorenknieper.github.io/farmish/).


## 02 November 2020 
First day of coding is done. I've worked for 30 minutes on this code. I've searched everything online. 
The first thing I tried was making a menu based on the mock-ups Robin and I made. 
The next thing was settingup the background and researching flex again because I forgot how to use this system,... It was my first time using it again since 2016. 
The middle page was easy. After searching a lot of information about flexbox and how to use it, it was now much easier and I could just code and style it on the go. 

After the middle section of the website was done, I started with the footer. Since it was almost after midnight, I was to tired to finish it. So next up is finishing the basic footer. 

When the basic is done, I'm planing to make the website even more beautiful. Maybe do some scripting,... We'll see.
